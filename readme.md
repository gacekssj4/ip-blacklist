# Bad IP and Network Blocklist

This repository contains a **private list of IP addresses and entire networks** that have exhibited malicious or unwanted behavior. These IPs or networks have been detected sending spam or generating excessive requests, significantly increasing server costs by creating **millions of requests per day**.

We maintain this list primarily for **our own use**, but you are welcome to use it if you find it helpful.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- **Use at your own risk.**  
  We are not responsible for any unintended consequences, such as loss of legitimate traffic, service disruptions, or blocked users.  

- **No liability.**  
  This list is provided without any warranty. By using this list, you accept full responsibility for any impact it may have on your services.

## ❓ Why Block Entire IP Ranges?

Blocking entire IP ranges or networks can be an aggressive measure, but it becomes necessary when:

- The **network owners** consistently ignore abuse reports and fail to take action against malicious traffic.  
- The source of abuse is widespread across a network, making it impractical to block individual IP addresses.  
- It helps **reduce server load** and mitigate security threats by eliminating large sources of spam and malicious activity.

**However**, be aware that banning entire ranges can unintentionally block legitimate traffic, especially if the IP ranges belong to large hosting providers or ISPs. Always review the impact of these blocks on your services.
